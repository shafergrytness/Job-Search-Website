# Web Scraping Job Search Website*
*Web scraper not included!

Unfortunately our scraper was lost to the school server. However, a web scraper named runJobScraper.php running embedded Python with proper data formatting could easily be included to achieve the full functionality of this project. Ours was programmed using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

Otherwise, the account creation and information storage system is fully functional and set up for interfacing with a MySQL database, although the information in DatabaseInfo.php should be substituted with appropriate login credentials for your locally hosted database.
